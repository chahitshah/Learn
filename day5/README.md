# CSS Position Learning

This project is made to learn **CSS position property**.

I practiced how different position values work and how elements move on the screen.

---

## What I Learned

### 1. position: static
- Default position
- Elements follow normal flow
- top, left, right, bottom do not work

---

### 2. position: relative
- Element stays in its place
- Can move using top or left
- Used as reference for absolute child

---

### 3. position: absolute
- Element is removed from normal flow
- Moves relative to nearest positioned parent
- Can go outside the parent

---

### 4. position: fixed
- Element stays fixed on screen
- Does not move when scrolling

---

### 5. position: sticky
- Works like relative first
- Becomes fixed when scrolling

---

## Conclusion

This project helped me understand:
- How CSS position works
- Difference between relative and absolute
- Why elements go outside the parent

This is useful for making layouts and websites.
